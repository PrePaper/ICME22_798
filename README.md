# MM21-paper-id-2418
Pytorch code for paper 2418: "MUGS: Multimodal Rumor Detection by Multigranular Structure Learning"

# overview
This directory contains code necessary to run the MUGS. MUGS is a multimodal rumor detection network by multimodal granular structure learning. See our paper for details on the code.

# dataset
The meta-data of the Weibo and Twitter datasets used in our experiments are available in the reference papers. In this project, we provide the representations generated by the [keras-bert model](https://github.com/CyberZHG/keras-bert) in the pre_data subdirectory for easy use.

# requirements
Recent versions of Pytorch, numpy, scipy, and sklearn are required. You can install all the required packages using the following command:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To guarantee that you have the right package versions, you can use Anaconda to create a new environment.

# running the code
The train.py is the main file for running the code.
```
$ python train.py
```
